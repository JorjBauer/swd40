LX,LY are the left Analog Stick X and Y (0-63), RX and RY are the
right Analog Stick X and Y (0-31), and LT and RT are the Left and
Right Triggers (0-31). The left Analog Stick has twice the precision
of the other analog values.

BD{L,R,U,D} are the D-Pad direction buttons. B{ZR,ZL,A,B,X,Y,+,H,-}
are the discrete buttons. B{LT,RT} are the digital button click of LT
and RT. All buttons are 0 when pressed.

Nintendo games calibrate the center position of the Analog Sticks upon
power-up or insertion of the Classic Controller.
