A1
  Moteino with RFM69 and onboard flash
  Code: arduino_dalek_sender.ino
  runs from +12v
  Purpose: primary controller. Listens on RF; drives primary motor controllers;
    delegates commands to other arduinos over serial.


A2
  Arduino Uno clone
  Code: arduino_dalek_shouldermotor.ino
  runs from +12v
  Daughterboards: Pololu motor shield
  Purpose: secondary controller. When told over serial, will run the shoulder 
    motors and the gun aim motor.

A3
  Arduino Uno
  Code: arduino_dalek_wav.ino
  runs from +12v
  Daughterboards: Adafruit WAV shield
  Purpose: primary audio engine; also runs the mist generator, fan to blow 
    it, and LEDs
