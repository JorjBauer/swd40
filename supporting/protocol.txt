The remote decides what it should be sending, in terms of motor
percentage and direction.

F: next command(s) will be forward
B: next command(s) will be backward
0-9: next command(s) will be 0-90%
:: (colon) next command(s) will be 100% (colon is the ascii character after 9)
L: set Left motor settings based on existing settings
R: set Right motor settings based on existing settings
G: Go, 1 pulse, based on existing settings of L and R motors

(: rotate head left 1 pulse
): rotate head right 1 pulse
^: move gun up one pulse
v: move gun down one pulse

Still need to figure out speech and stuff, if we do that.
