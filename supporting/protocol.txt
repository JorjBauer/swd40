The remote decides what it should be sending, in terms of motor
percentage and direction.

This protocol is correct as of 10/12/2016.

F: next command(s) will be forward
B: next command(s) will be backward
0-9: next command(s) will be 0-90%
:: (colon) next command(s) will be 100% (colon is the ascii character after 9)
L: set Left motor settings based on current settings
R: set Right motor settings based on current settings
G: Go, 1 pulse, based on current settings of both L and R motors
   The drive system will carry this pulse forward for 200mS. As long as a 
   stream of 'G' pulses comes in faster than one every 200mS, the motors will 
   run continuously.

(: rotate head left 1 pulse
): rotate head right 1 pulse
^: move gun up one pulse
v: move gun down one pulse

m: hard-stop motors (Brake) and stop all sound that might be playing
   (Brake will stay on for 200mS, just like 'G' pulses.)

M#: play a sound with the given # (0-9)
    0: x button
    1: y button
    2: A button
    3: B button
    4: left shoulder button (firing noise)
    5: right shoulder button ("exterminate!")
    6: left D
    7: right D
    8: up D
    9: down D
